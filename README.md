# Data Server - Record Shop Workshops

This repo hosts a series of workshops on creating a traditional RESTfull API using Node, Express and Mongoose. The workshops are following DCI's curriculum structure. A basic reference on how we move in our project is this series of tutorials by [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51q4D-B63KBnygU6opNPFk_q). Please bookmark the video playlist for future reference.

## The way it works

This repo has several branches with several stages of the development of the final app. For each stage, a list of changes will be added to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file, to explain the changes made.

If you need a reminder on how this app changed through each of the workshops, simply checkout the branch for the phase you are interested in, and read the changelog.
